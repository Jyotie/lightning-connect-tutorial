In this tutorial, you use Lightning Connect to integrate order data from an external data source, without writing a line of code, and without duplicating any data into Salesforce. You will configure relationships between external objects and accounts in Salesforce, and see how external objects integrate with Chatter and the Salesforce1 mobile app.
